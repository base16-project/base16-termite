# tinted-termite


A [Tinted Theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home). template repository for [Termite].

tinted-termite provides a simple template that can be used with the
base16 and base24 color schemes to generate a functional config file for
[thestinger/termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite), a
keyboard-centric VTE-based terminal.

To use, you can copy one of the config files in themes/ or use curl:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/termite
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinted-theming/tinted-termite/main/themes/base16-default-dark.config >> ~/.config/termite/config
```
